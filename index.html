        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <details>
        <summary>Please check my details.</summary>
        <p>The year was <strong>2001</strong>, and as the new century dawned, I entered this world with my first cry. Now, I'm about to welcome my 23rd spring. In my early days, I lived as a true multi-player - <strong>swimming</strong> like a water sprite, pouring sweat with spirited kiais in the <strong>karate</strong> dojo, and celebrating youth with my teammates on the <strong>basketball</strong> court.</p>
        <p>During my university years, I encountered the essence of an inclusive society where people acknowledge and support each other. This learning planted the seed of altruism in my heart, which eventually grew into a mighty tree that shaped my life philosophy. Simultaneously, I opened the magical door of cinema, journeying through infinite worlds through <strong>500 films</strong>. This experience nurtured my soul, enriched my heart, and above all, gave me the ability to understand the complex narrative of life more deeply.</p>
        <p>In February 2024, I embarked on my life's greatest adventure. Together with my beloved girlfriend, we drove across the Japanese archipelago, carrying our dreams in our cherished car. My heart was captured by <strong>Hokkaido</strong>'s endless landscapes, my soul was stirred by <strong>Hiroshima</strong>'s prayers for peace, and I was enchanted by <strong>Kagoshima</strong>'s magnificent nature. Each of these places left an indelible mark on my heart. Like scenes from a movie, beautiful landscapes and heartwarming encounters colored our journey.</p>
        <p>And now, a new chapter has begun as a web developer. My days are spent wrestling with code at work and dedicating my evenings to self-improvement with technical books in hand. As I navigate the vast seas of <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> and race across the wilderness of JavaScript, I see reflections of my younger self who once devoted everything to swimming, karate, and basketball. The creativity learned from movies, the perseverance cultivated through sports, and the spirit of coexistence that sprouted in university - all these have become the foundation supporting my passion for web development. In this endless digital world, I continue to surge forward today, tomorrow, and beyond, sailing with the wind of passion in my sails.</p>
